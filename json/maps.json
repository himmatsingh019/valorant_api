        "displayName": "ASCENT",
        "feature": "Ascent is a map set in Italy that features a large, open middle area that both teams can skirmish over. Mid is a playground for diverse ability use and successfully controlling the area opens additional routes for Attackers to both Spike sites. The map's 'unique' feature is mechanical doors leading into sites. Each site has one door (A Link for A and Market for B) that is opened at the start of each round. Players can use a switch on the site side of the door (Next to the door on A and on a table in Toolshed on B) to close or open the door. These doors are impenetrable while closed, but players can damage the doors to eventually destroy them, leaving the doorway permanently open.",
        "description": "An open playground for small wars of position and attrition divide two sites on Ascent. Each site can be fortified by irreversible bomb doors; once they’re down, you’ll have to destroy them or find another way. Yield as little territory as possible.",

        "description": "If you want to go far, you’ll have to go up. A pair of sites split by an elevated center allows for rapid movement using two rope ascenders. Each site is built with a looming tower vital for control. Remember to watch above before it all blows sky-high.",

        "displayName": "BIND",
        "feature": "Bind's 'unique' feature is that it doesn't contain a mid section, instead having two one-way teleporters. One takes players from A Short to B Short and the other takes players from B Long to A Lobby. Players use teleporters by walking into the section of wall taken up by the teleport entrance. They will then instantly arrive in a small exit room which players leave by walking towards the door out of the room. This door is closed by default and can only be opened by players inside the exit room walking up to it, at which point they will open automatically. Players outside the exit room cannot open these doors, but they can be penetrated by gunfire. Other objects can also be sent through teleporters if they come into contact with the teleporter entrance. They will maintain any velocity they had before being teleported and can open the doors and leave the exit room should they travel far enough to trigger the door sensor. Objects include abilities, the spike, and dropped weapons. Whenever a teleporter is used by an agent or an object, all players on the map will be given an audio cue.",
        "description": "Two sites. No middle. Gotta pick left or right. What’s it going to be then? Both offer direct paths for attackers and a pair of one-way teleporters make it easier to flank.",

On the defending side players can use the rope at the back of A Site to get onto Bridge and into Hall, and on the attacking side players can use the rope in A Lobby to get into Hall.A Site has an impenetrable, indestructible mechanical door leading into A Hall that can be opened and closed using switches on either side. The door is closed at the start of each round. Towards the Attacker side of Hall is a one-way chute (known as a 'vent') that can be used to go to Mid.",
        "description": "Take in the sights of historic ruins or seaside caves on this tropical paradise. But bring some cover. You'll need them for the wide open spaces and long range engagements. Watch your flanks and this will be a Breeze.",

        "description": "Beneath a forgotten monastery, a clamour emerges from rival Agents clashing to control three sites. There’s more territory to control, but defenders can use the extra real estate for aggressive pushes.",

This map emphasizes skirmishes, sharp aim, and adaptive play. It is also the first map where the plant site has different levels of elevation. Both sites contain nests that players can get into using ropes and then plant the spike on the nest floor.",
        "description": "Your next battleground is a secret Kingdom excavation site overtaken by the arctic. The two plant sites protected by snow and metal require some horizontal finesse. Take advantage of the ziplines and they’ll never see you coming.",
