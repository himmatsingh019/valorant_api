Her abilities include a teleportation-based dash and an updraft that lets her reach higher ledges. She also has a smokebomb ability to hinder sightlines and a powerful Bladestorm ultimate that deals moderate-to-heavy damage and remains accurate even while she's moving. Jett is one of the few Agents with a passive ability. Holding the jump key while in the air will allow Jett to slow her descent.\n\nJett's Ultimate allows her to wield several throwing knives that deal moderate damage and kill on headshots. Getting a kill replenishes your daggers and you can choose to throw them one at a time or throw all remaining daggers in a short-ranged burst.\n\nJett is a fair-skinned, short girl, being the smallest of the VALORANT agents. She has white hair, which she ties in a bun on the back. Her bangs are rather long and remain stably locked. Her eyes are a shade of blue, and she looks like she wears eyeliner.
